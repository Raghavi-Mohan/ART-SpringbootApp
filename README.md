# ART-SpringbootApp


Welcome to the TextureAndTones Spring boot app. 

I am a developer and an artist so why not merge art and technology? 
I am creating this small Spring Boot app that will return my artwork based on the painting's name. In the future, I will create a base UI as well for easy access. 

Completed paintings -

1. Budha - http://localhost:8080/image/Budha
2. babyKrishna - http://localhost:8080/image/babyKrishna
3. homeSweetHome - http://localhost:8080/image/homeSweetHome
4. Gopuram - http://localhost:8080/image/Gopuram
5. girlAndGuitar - http://localhost:8080/image/girlAndGuitar




To view just the painting copy the above URL or just replace the painting name instead of {paintingName} to - http://localhost:8080/image/{paintingName} 

To view the making video of the painting you can use the below URL in the same way by just replacing the paint name - http://localhost:8080/video/{paintingName}
